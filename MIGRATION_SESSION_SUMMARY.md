# UI to UI-Native Migration Session Summary

## Migration Work Completed

### 🔧 Infrastructure Improvements

1. **Fixed Visual Comparison System**

   - Successfully enabled detailed visual comparisons with difference highlighting

2. **Git Submodule Setup**
   - Initialized and updated the UI Git submodule to access original UI components
   - Successfully pulled UI project with 541 snapshots for comparison

### 🎯 Component Improvements

1. **Button Component Optimization** (`components/primitives/button/Button.tsx`)
   - **Letter Spacing**: Fixed from 0.5px to 0.4px to match UI's `tracking-wide` (0.025em)
   - **Font Family**: Updated to use system font instead of monospace for better web consistency
